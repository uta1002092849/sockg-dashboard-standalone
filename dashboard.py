#     <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
#     <p>Accurate soil carbon data is essential for quantifying carbon credits and encouraging sustainable farming practices that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>The SOCKG Dashboard provides an interactive interface to explore the Soil Organic Carbon Knowledge Graph (SOCKG) and its underlying data. The dashboard allows users to query and visualize SOCKG knowledge graph without any prerequisites knowledge of Neo4j knowledge graph query language.</p>
<p>The dashboard is divided into two main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Data Exploration:</b> This section allows users to explore the knowledge graph by selecting an entity of interest. Once selected, the dashboard will display that entity information, as well as some predefined information by joining with other entities in the knowledge graph.</li>
<li><b>Natural Language Query:</b> This section allows users to query the SOCKG knowledge graph using natural language queries. If the data exploration tab does not provide the information you are looking for, you can use the natural language query tab to ask questions about the knowledge graph.</li>
